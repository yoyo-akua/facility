<!--REPETITION
1. What do you need?
    - A text editor (In fact you can use any of them, but some are easier to handle than others. 
                    Last time I recommended NotepadQQ to you, but I've discovered Visual Basic in the meantime, 
                    which is a very useful tool in terms of debugging.)
    - LAMPP (I hope you still have it, if not, let me know.)
    - It can also be very useful to install "Teamviewer" which is an application that enables me to operate your PC by remote control.
        That can help in case you are stuck with any problems and want me to have a look on it or navigate you out (if I can).

2. How to create a source code file
    - 

How is a html page set up?

First of all: This is a comment. 
It is marked in green (at least on my PC) and the browser will jump this text when executing the code.
